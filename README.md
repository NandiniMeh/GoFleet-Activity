## Developer Information

üë©‚Äçüíª Developer: Nandini Mehrotra

Hi There! Here's my submission for the GoFleet developer activity. Please read on for some important information.

### Notes:
- To trigger a production build, use the command `ng build --configuration=production` instead of ng build --prod (This is necessary for Angular CLI versions newer than 6, as the --prod flag is no longer used).
- The application provides the ability to filter submissions by their status. Simply select a status from the dropdown menu to apply the filter.
- The list of submissions, which contains arbitrary information, is scrollable, allowing you to view a large number of submissions with ease.
